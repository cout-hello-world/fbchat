# fbchat
This tool is based on
[facebook-chat-api](https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api). It allows
one to chat on Facebook from the command line.

## Usage
To use this, install a version of `node` with ES6 support as well as
`facebook-chat-api`. Then place a configuration file like the example provided
in your working directory without the `.example` extension.

Use `/join <friend>` to chat with `<friend>`.

## To Do
This project is in a very early stage of development, so there is a lot to do.

1.  Add error handling.
2.  Reprint interrupted message to be sent.
3.  Add file uploading with `/file`.
4.  Support group chat.

## Contributing
Feel free to send me a pull request if youâ€™ve implemented some other features
from `facebook-chat-api` or cleaned up the code or fixed bugs. Alternatively,
file an issue for any problems you encounter.
